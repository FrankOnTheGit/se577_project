Selection of secure hosting platform
==================================== 

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------
There are multiple platforms that could host the JFS Healthcare tool. One must be selected that can keep costs low and help maintain HIPAA compliance.

Considered Options
------------------
There are many options available. AWS, Atlantic, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace were mainly evaluated in depth. Each overs tiered pricing plans that can be changed as needed. All offer HIPAA compliance with certifications and security frameworks in place that are appropriate for a tool that will store healthcare records. 

Decision
--------
The decision to AWS was made based upon the immense track record and highest value for the options given. With pricing based on usage with hardware exclusively for developing HIPAA compliant services, AWS is the most prepared to host HIPAA compliant services, and the most experienced at doing so. Other options offered more structured pricing options (like Azure seemingly ala carte pricing) that would likely not meet JFS’s needs ideally, resulting in features and options that are paid for being left unutilized. Other options, like Rackspace, offer public cloud based solutions that could introduce additional security issues and indicate inexperience in healthcare industry solutions.

Consequences
------------
The many features available within the AWS hosting solution introduce higher costs. Further, training would likely be required for JFS developers to ensure optimal use can be made of the platform and available resources, while minimizing required support from Amazon developers. Also, a PC Mag editor rating of only ‘Good’ will require additional efforts to ensure patient data privacy in a TBD fashion.
